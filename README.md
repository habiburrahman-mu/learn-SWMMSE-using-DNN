A Deep Neural Network Based Optimization Approach for Wireless Resource Management

This repository contains the implementations of the following paper:

**M. H. Rahman** and M. M. Mowla, "**[A Deep Neural Network Based Optimization Approach for Wireless Resource Management](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9230822),**" 2020 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP), Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2020, pp. 803-806, doi: 10.1109/TENSYMP50017.2020.9230822.

Requirements:

     1. Tensorflow 1.x
     2. Numpy
     3. Scipy

First generate the data (.mat) using `data-generator.py`, then run `main.py` for training and testing.

For further visualization, you can use `matplotlib`.
